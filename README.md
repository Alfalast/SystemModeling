Mathematical and programming models of different (dynamic) systems.

## Code

Most of the projects in this repository are made with [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica).

Some of the projects have 
[Modelica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelica) 
code or 
[R](https://www.r-project.org)
code. 

Some of the projects have parts made with 
[SystemModeler](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/).

The projects are put in separate folders. Generally each project folder has dedicated code dub-folders.
The universal code (packages) are put in the (top-level) repository folders. 
See [WL](./WL).

## Presentations 

Individual presentations have sub-folders in the folder 
[Presentation](./Presentations).
