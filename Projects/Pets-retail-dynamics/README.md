# Pets retail dynamics

This project has models for different aspects of Pets retail dynamics.

## The model

The following mind-map illustrates the scope of the model considered:

## Data analysis

In order to build or confirm certain modeling conjectures and assumptions data analysis is made
for Seattle pets licensing data.
The data was taken from the page
["Seattle Pet Licenses"](https://data.seattle.gov/Community/Seattle-Pet-Licenses/jguv-t9rb/data). 

## First simple model

Generally speaking, the 
[System dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics) 
methodology is used. 

The first model is uses a lot of simplifying assumptions and deals only with owned dogs and dog food.

Nevertheless, the model provides certain insight and it is a good starting point for multiple types of
model extensions. 

Here is component interaction diagram:

## Model extensions plan

TBD...

### Adding dog ages and weight

### Adding cats

### Adding birds and other species

### Adding retail services 

### Adding time dependent rates 

## Calibration

At this point no plans are made to calibrate the model to, say, a particular combination of 
a geographic region and pets retail company.
