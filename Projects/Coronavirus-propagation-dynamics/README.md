# Coronavirus propagation dynamics

This project has models for different aspects of Coronavirus propagation dynamics.
More specifically the focus is on the propagation of 
[SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2)
and the economic impact of 
[COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019). 

## The model

The following mind-map illustrates the scope of the considered model:

## Data analysis

In order to build or confirm certain modeling conjectures and assumptions certain data analysis is required.

(TBD...)

## First simple model

Generally speaking, the 
[System dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics) 
methodology is used. 

The first model uses a lot of simplifying assumptions and deals only with:

- four types of populations (meaning no age is included),

- available hospital beds,

- medical suppliers, and

- delivery of medical supplies.

Nevertheless, that simple model provides certain insights and it is a good starting point for multiple types of
model extensions. 

Here is a component interaction diagram:

Here is "a teaser" of how the simple model interactive interface looks like:
