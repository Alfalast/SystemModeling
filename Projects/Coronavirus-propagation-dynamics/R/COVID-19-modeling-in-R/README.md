# COVID-19 modeling in R

This R project has code, notebooks, and documents that exemplify data analysis and modeling of COVID-19 using R.

Here are preview links of HTML versions of some the notebooks:

- ["New York Times COVID-19 data visualization"](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/antononcube/SystemModeling/blob/master/Projects/Coronavirus-propagation-dynamics/R/COVID-19-modeling-in-R/notebooks/NY-Times-COVID-19-data-visualization.nb.html)

- ["Apple mobility trends data visualization"](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/antononcube/SystemModeling/blob/master/Projects/Coronavirus-propagation-dynamics/R/COVID-19-modeling-in-R/notebooks/Apple-mobility-trends-data-visualization.nb.html)

Most of the R-notebooks in this project have Mathematica counterparts. (See this
