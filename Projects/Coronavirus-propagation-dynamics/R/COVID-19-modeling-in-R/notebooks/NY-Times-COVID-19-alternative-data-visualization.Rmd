```{r}
library(hexbin)
```

# Geo-histogram

## ggplot2

Not that these are just location denistities:

```{r}
ggplot( dsNYDataCountiesExtended[, c("Lat", "Lon", "Cases")] ) +
  geom_hex( aes( x = Lon, y = Lat ) )
```

## hexbin

This would have been nice if worked with less obscure workflow/option settings:

```{r}
hb2 <- hexbin::hexbin( x = dsNYDataCountiesExtended$Lon, y = dsNYDataCountiesExtended$Lat, xbins = 20, xlab = "Longitude", ylab = "Latitude" )
P <- plot(hb2, type="n", main = "Cases" )
hexbin::pushHexport(P$plot.vp)
hexbin::grid.hexagons(hb2, style= "nested.centroids", mincnt = 2, use.count = FALSE, cell.at = dsNYDataCountiesExtended$Cases )
grid::popViewport()
```
