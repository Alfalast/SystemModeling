* Introduction
- This org-mode file has a work plan for the [[https://wirvsvirushackathon.org][WirVsVirus Hackathon]] :
  https://wirvsvirushackathon.org .
* DONE Registration [100%] [2/2]
  - [X] Anton
  - [X] Balint
  - [C] Diego
* DONE Idea description entering
 1) Title:
	- "Geo-spatial-temporal Economic Model for COVID-19 Propagation and Management in Germany"
 2) What is the challenge or need?
	- How can we predict the propagation of COVID-19 in Germany and
	  the effects of different related (governmental) policies?
	- We want to estimate (i) the infected / deceased /
	  recovered people and (ii) the economy effects of different quarantine programs.
 3) Who it helps?
	- Decision makers at government level.
	- Decision makers at healthcare provider (hospitals) level.
	- Corporate decision makers.
 4) Choice of topics
	- [ ] Kommunikation & Informationsvermittlung an Bürger*innen
	- [X] Medizinische Versorgung
	- [ ] Schutz von Risikogruppen
	- [X] Prävention von Verbreitung des COVID-19
	- [X] Deutsche Wirtschaft: Krisenmanagement für Unternehmen & Selbstständige
	- [ ] Solidarität und Zusammenhalt
	- [ ] Leben in (Selbst-)Quarantäne
	- [ ] Andere
 5) Who is effected by it?
	- General population.
	- Medical personnel.
	- Decision makers at state or municipality levels.
 6) How would you formulate challenge?
	- Make a prototype of a Geo-spatial-temporal model for the propagation of
	  infectious disease over Germany.
	- The model should have features that allow the evaluation of effects on both human population and economy.
	- Make simulations of different COVID-19 scenarios.
 7) Is there already some concepts / prototypes developed?
	- There are multiple implementations and documentation for the
	  approach we want to take and develop. See the GitHub
	  repository:
	  - [[https://github.com/antononcube/SystemModeling/tree/master/Projects/Coronavirus-propagation-dynamics][Coronavirus-propagation-dynamics]].
 8) What is your role?
	- Hacker / developer.
 9) Who are the most important stakeholders?
	- Governmental decision makers.
	- Healthcare providers managers.
	- Commercial companies decision makers.

* DONE Application of the "COVID-19 propagation over USA" model to Germany [0%] [0/3]
** Description
- Basically we want to replicate Diego's work over Germany.
  - Here is a link to the related WL-notebook:
    - [[https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/dzviovich/Published/Geo-spatial-temporal%20COVID-19%20simulations%20and%20visualizations%20over%20USA.nb][Geo-spatial-temporal COVID-19 simulations and visualizations over USA.nb]]
** TODO Data gathering [0%] [0/2]
*** Balint Municipalities
*** Diego Road network and throughput
** Anton Patient-0 propagation simulations
- [X] Initial Geo-spatial-temporal simulation of COVID-19 propagation over Germany.
- [X] Over German states and/or municipalities.
** TODO Scenario simulations [25%] [.]
*** DONE Quarantines 
- Basic quarantine scenarios.
  - Different start point and duration.
- Comprehensive quarantine scenarios.
  - Per state.
  - Per industry.
*** TODO Isolation of age groups
*** TODO Borders and travel restrictions
*** TODO State-specific quarantines
* CANCELED Calibration [0%] [0/2]
** Balint Single-site model calibrations
** Diego Multi-site model calibratrions
* TODO Economic extension(s) [33%] [1/3]
** DONE Using SEI2RH-Econ 
** TODO Census data
- Needed to evaluate the costs of people not working.
- Different age groups.
- Different industry / occupation tiers.
** TODO Add limited resources
- What limited resources should we consider?
- So far the models have only hospital beds and medical supplies as
  limited resources.
* CANCELED Comprehensive economic model
** MAYBE Apply the economic model with the multi-site model
** MAYBE Scenario play-outs
