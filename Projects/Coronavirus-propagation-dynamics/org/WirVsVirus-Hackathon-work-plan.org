* Introduction
- This org-mode file has a work plan for the [[https://wirvsvirushackathon.org][WirVsVirus Hackathon]] :
  https://wirvsvirushackathon.org .
* TODO Registration [0%] [0/2]
- [-] Names and emails.
  - [X] Anton
  - [X] Balint
  - [ ] Diego
- [ ] Idea description entering 
  1) Title:
     - "Geo-spatial-temporal Economic Model for COVID-19 Propagation and Management in Germany"
  2) What is the challenge or need?
     - How can we predict the propagation of COVID-19 in Germany and
       the effects of different related (govermental) policies?
     - We are both interest in estimating the infected / deceased /
       recovered people and economy effects of different quarantine programs.
  3) Who it helps?
     - Decision makers at government level.
     - Decision makers at healthcare provider (hospitals) level.
  4) Who is effected by it?
     - General population.
     - Medical personnel.
     - Decision makers at state or municipality levels.
  5) Choice of topics
     - [ ] Kommunikation & Informationsvermittlung an B�rger*innen
     - [ ] Medizinische Versorgung
     - [ ] Schutz von Risikogruppen
     - [X] Pr�vention von Verbreitung des COVID-19
     - [ ] Deutsche Wirtschaft: Krisenmanagement f�r Unternehmen & Selbstst�ndige
     - [ ] Solidarit�t und Zusammenhalt
     - [X] Leben in (Selbst-)Quarant�ne
     - [ ] Andere
  6) How would you formulate challenge?
     - Make a prototype of Geo-spatial-temporal model for the propagation of
       infectious disease over Germany.
     - The model should have features that allow the evaluation of effects on both human population and economy.
     - Using the model simulate different COVID-19 scenarios.
  7) Is there already some concepts / prototypes developed?
     - There are multiple implementation and documentation for the
       approach we want to take and develop. See the GitHub
       repository:
       - [[https://github.com/antononcube/SystemModeling/tree/master/Projects/Coronavirus-propagation-dynamics][Coronavirus-propagation-dynamics]].
  8) What is your role?
     - Hacker / developer.
  9) Who are the most important stakeholders?
     - Governmental decision makers.
     - Healthcare providers decision managers.
