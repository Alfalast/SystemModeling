# Large scale air pollution modeling

This project folder is mostly created for references.

Large Scale Air Pollution Modeling (LSAPM) provides rich sets of problems and modeling approaches.
This project has references to LSAPM articles and models. 
The articles and PhD thesis related to my LSAPM studies can be found in project's sub-folders.
