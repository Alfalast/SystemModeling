**Tutorial presentation**

## In brief

In this tutorial presentation we are going to:

1. Discuss the modeling and evolution of different dynamic systems, like:
   - Pets retail
   - Coronavirus propagation and related disease
   - Economy recession cycles

2. Overview classic compartmental models in epidemiology

3. Discuss the theory behind the System Dynamics approach using simple examples

4. Discus philosophical, scientific, and mathematical justifications

5. Describe System Dynamics' approaches of modeling in general

The presentation can be seen as an introduction to System Dynamics: we are going to progress from simple models to more complicated ones.

Our focus is on the modeling strategy and techniques and how they can be implemented using different programming languages and software systems. 

Most of the examples used to illustrate the theoretical concepts and practical aspects will have graphics visualizations. 
The more important examples will have interactive interfaces.

Here is a mind-map that shows presentation's structure:
