* DONE Opening
- Goals:
  - Discuss the modeling and evolution of different scenarios of the coronavirus propagation and related decease
  - Overview classic compartmental models in epidemiology
  - Discuss the theory behind the System dynamics approach using simple examples
  - Discus philosophical, scientific, and mathematical justifications
  - Describe System dynamics' approaches of modeling the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 and the economic impact of COVID-19
- [[https://github.com/antononcube/ECMMon-R][ECMMon-R GitHub repository]]
- [[https://github.com/antononcube/SystemModeling/tree/master/Projects/Coronavirus-propagation-dynamics]["Coronavirus propagation dynamics" project of SystemDynamics at GitHub]]
* DONE What we are going to do? 
- We have two screens...
- /Narrate the mind-map/
- Quick overview of the most interesting parts of the talk in the first 5-10 minutes.
  - So you can go and do something else.
* DONE Who am I?
- /Basically the host did this for me./
- I an applied mathematician.
- Currently I brand myself as a "Senior data scientist."
** MUST [#A] Education
- MSc Computer Science (Data Bases)
- MSc Mathematics (Abstract Algebra)
- PhD Applied Mathematics (Large Scale Air-Pollution Simulations)
  - That is a very relevant background for building software
    frameworks for pandemics.
** MUST [#A] General experience
- After I finished my PhD I worked for WRI for 7 years as a kernel developer.
- Working with Machine Learning and Data Science in the last 12 years.
- I think AI, ML, DS should be seen through the lens of Operations
  Research. 
* DONE In case you hear things you not like [50%] [2/4]
- [X] I guarantee you many of the employers I engage(d) with would not like
  everything I plan to say.
- [X] But I exaggerate and over-simplify in order to drive a point.
- [ ] It is like eating vegetables:
  - even if you do not like them they are good for you.
- [ ] If you do not like what you hear please write me an (extensive) email about how
  wrong I am:
  - antononcube@gmail.com
* DONE Managing expectations 
- This talk in not about Data Science or Statistics.
  - Typically what R is used in.
- Statistics and Data Science are not adequate enough for this kind of models.
- Accentuate on what we do when we encounter these kind of problems.
* DONE Big picture
- The modelers and decision makers flow chart
  - It is important to see and keep in mind what is the big picture we
    are doing our modeling with.
- COVID-19 from modeling perspective overview.
* DONE Modeling considerations
- [X] Two main modeling paradigms.
- [X] ABM -- not used in this presentation -- gives a
  convenient introduction to the building intuition about the modeling
  approach we consider.
* DONE System Dynamics
- [X] Made in the 50's at MIT...
- [X] /System Modeler/ example:
  - Based on /Modelica/
  - Using the "SystemDynamics" package
- [X] The R book and related GitHub repository
* DONE Single site models 
- [X] Using the R package "deSolve".
* DONE Using ~flexdashboard~
- [X] For convenience I programmed a few ~flexdashboards~ so they can be
  easily changed depending on user's experimentation needs.
- [X] Here is a dashboard with for quarantine scenarios...
- [X] Here is an extension with "Hubei data"...
* DONE Sensitivity analysis
- [X] Loops over quarantine starts and lengths
  - [X] 2D
  - [X] 3D
- [X] DIP being AUC
  - [X] Here is DIP in the code...
* DONE Multi-site models
- [-] (Regular) grid graph
  - [X] Wave
  - [X] Observations
  - [ ] Accumulated ISSP
- [X] Random graph
- [X] Hexagonal graph over USA
* CANCELED Story
* DONE Economy model and combination with the Epidemic one
- [X] Combination of models diagram
- [X] BEA tables
- [X] Leontief's Scientific American article
  - [C] /Hosted at MIT it looks like from URL.../
* CANCELED Conclusion
