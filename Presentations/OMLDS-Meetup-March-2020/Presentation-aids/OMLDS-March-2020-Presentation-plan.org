- [[https://www.github.com/antononcube][GitHub repository]]
** Managing expectations
- What you are not going to see or hear?
- What is presentation tutorial about?
- Tools used:
  - System Dynamics
  - Mathematica
- *Not* about Data Science or Machine Learning or Statistics.
- The most interesting model visuals are going to be presented first.
- Goals 
** Warm up 
- COVID-19 in brief
- "NY Times data visualization"
- "Patient-0 SARS-CoV-2 propagation over USA"
  - Propagation
  - Quarantine scenarios
* Concepts and methods
** Methodologies to model epidemics
*** System Dynamics
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics][Created at MIT in 50's]].
- Equation Based Method 
*** /Agent based simulations/ 
*** /Cellular automata/
** Basic definitions
- [[https://github.com/antononcube/SystemModeling/blob/master/Projects/Coronavirus-propagation-dynamics/Documents/Coronavirus-propagation-modeling-considerations.md][Coronavirus propagation modeling considerations]]
- SIR model
- SEI2R model
** Basic workflows with more comprehensive models
- SEI2HR model
- SEI3HR-Econ model
** Milti-site modeling
- Grid graph
- Random graph
* Concrete examples 
** Over USA
- Data set-up
