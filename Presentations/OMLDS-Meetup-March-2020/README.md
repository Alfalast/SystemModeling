# Coronavirus propagation modeling tutorial presentation, OMLDS March 2020

The presentation abstract heavily borrowed descriptions and plans from a similar presentation
to be given for the 
[useR! Boston Meetup in April](../UseR!-Meetup-Boston-2020).

This presentation was almost entirely based on frameworks, simulations, and graphics made with
[Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica).
For some parts 
[Wolfram System Modeler](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/) 
was used. 

Here is the (main) presentation mind-map:

(Note that mind-map's PDF has hyperlinks.)

The presentation was given online (because of COVID-19) using Zoom. 
The [maximum number of people registered, 100](https://www.meetup.com/Orlando-MLDS/events/269445903/).
(Many were "first timers.") Nearly 60 showed up (and stayed throughout.)
