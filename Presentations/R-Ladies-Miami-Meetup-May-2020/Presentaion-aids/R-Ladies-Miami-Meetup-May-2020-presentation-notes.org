#+TODO: TODO MAYBE MUST | DONE CANCELED 
#+OPTIONS: toc:1 num:1


* TODO Opening
- Goals:
  - Discuss the modeling and evolution of different scenarios of the coronavirus propagation and related decease
  - Overview classic compartmental models in epidemiology
  - Describe general methodology
- [[https://github.com/antononcube/ECMMon-R][ECMMon-R GitHub repository]]
- [[https://github.com/antononcube/SystemModeling/tree/master/Projects/Coronavirus-propagation-dynamics]["Coronavirus propagation dynamics" project of SystemDynamics at GitHub]]
* TODO What we are going to do? 
- We have two screens...
  - For the presentation
  - For R and Mathematica
- /Narrate the mind-map/
- Quick overview of the most interesting parts of the talk in the first 5-10 minutes.
  - So you can go and do something else.
* MAYBE Who am I?
- /Basically the host did this for me./
- I am an applied mathematician.
- Currently I brand myself as a "Senior data scientist."
- Writing three books. See
  - [[https://github.com/antononcube/HowToBeADataScientistImpostor-book]["How to be a data scientist impostor?"]]
** MUST [#A] Education
- MSc Computer Science (Data Bases)
- MSc Mathematics (Abstract Algebra)
- PhD Applied Mathematics (Large Scale Air-Pollution Simulations)
  - That is a very relevant background for building software
    frameworks for pandemics.
** MUST [#A] General experience
- After I finished my PhD I worked for WRI for 7 years as a kernel developer.
- Working with Machine Learning and Data Science in the last 12 years.
- I think AI, ML, DS should be seen through the lens of Operations
  Research.
* MAYBE In case you hear things you not like [0%] [0/4]
- [ ] I guarantee you many of the employers I engage(d) with would not like
  everything I plan to say.
- [ ] But I exaggerate and over-simplify in order to drive a point.
- [ ] It is like eating vegetables:
  - even if you do not like them they are good for you.
- [ ] If you do not like what you hear please write an (extensive) email about how
  wrong I am to the meetup organizers.
* TODO Managing expectations 
- This talk in about Data Science or Statistics only to a point.
  - Typically what R is used in.
- Statistics and Data Science are not adequate enough for this kind of
  prolems and models.
- Accentuate on what we do when we encounter these kind of problems.
* TODO The three big pictures
- [ ] The modelers and decision makers flow chart
  - It is important to see and keep in mind what is the big picture we
    are doing our modeling with.

  - [ ] Related grand model: [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antononcube/SystemModeling/master/Projects/Coronavirus-propagation-dynamics/Diagrams/Epidemic-and-economy-model-combination.jpg][Epidemic and economy model combination]]
- [ ] COVID-19 from modeling perspective overview.
- [ ] The three books I am writing; see [[https://github.com/antononcube/HowToBeADataScientistImpostor-book]["How to be a data scientist impostor?"]]
* TODO Modeling considerations
- [ ] Two main modeling paradigms.
- [ ] ABM -- not used in this presentation -- gives a
  convenient introduction to the building intuition about the modeling
  approach we consider.
* TODO System Dynamics
- [X] Made in the 50's at MIT...
- [X] /System Modeler/ example:
  - Based on /Modelica/
  - Using the "SystemDynamics" package
- [X] The R book and related GitHub repository
* TODO Single site models 
- [X] Using the R package "deSolve".
* TODO Using ~flexdashboard~
- [X] For convenience I programmed a few ~flexdashboards~ so they can be
  easily changed depending on user's experimentation needs.
- [X] Here is a dashboard with for quarantine scenarios...
- [X] Here is an extension with "Hubei data"...
* TODO Sensitivity analysis
- [ ] Loops over quarantine starts and lengths
  - [ ] 2D
  - [ ] 3D
- [ ] DIP being AUC
  - [ ] Here is DIP in the code...
* TODO Multi-site models
- [ ] (Regular) grid graph
  - [ ] Wave
  - [ ] Observations
  - [ ] Accumulated ISSP
- [ ] Random graph
- [ ] Hexagonal graph over USA
* MAYBE Elements of package development
- From the poll this seems to be of little interest.
- But throughout the presentation I am going to talk about this elements.
  - It is inevitable in some sense.
* TODO Economy model and combination with the Epidemic one
- [X] Combination of models diagram
- [X] BEA tables
- [X] Leontief's Scientific American article
  - [C] /Hosted at MIT it looks like from URL.../
* TODO Conclusion
